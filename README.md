To build project you will need node.js at least 10.15.3 version (developed and checked on it).
Short instruction to build:
1. Run command "npm i" at the root directory of the project.
2. Go to ./projects/crazy-buttons-lib and run "ng build crazy-buttons-lib". If you get an error like "ng is not recognized...", then you will need to run "npm install -g @angular/cli" and add path to angular/cli to Environment Variables.
3. Go back to root project and run "npm start". Then the process is finished, app will be hosted on http://localhost:4200/
